Libunit is a 42 rush project (project realised on a week-end) consisting in building a library for unitary testing in C. The rush was realized by me (fbabin) and bleplat.

This project includes a framework to test functions in C language. As functions in C can crash (segfault) it forks and run the tested function in a child process to prevent your main test program from crashing.
